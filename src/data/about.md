# Intro
Hi, I'm Evelyn Yixuan (IPA: [i˥˩ɕyɛn˧˥]) Liu . I am currently an MS student in Computational Linguistics at the University at Buffalo, actively seeking full-time linguist or language specialist positions in the U.S. My research interests lie at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and phonetic analysis, where I explore the nuances of human language, speech processing, and AI-driven linguistic models.

# I Like

- Fitness: Acrobatics & upper body training (no I don't squat)
